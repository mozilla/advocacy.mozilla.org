postcrimes_step_2_2=Share this example:
postcrimes_step_2_3=For example, some countries limit your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:FixCopyright-_Copy_explains_%27Freedom_of_Panorama%27.webm">“freedom of panorama,”</a> which means you can take pictures of some public spaces in some countries and share them online, but not others.
postcrimes_step_2_4=Share a map like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_panorama#/media/File:Freedom_of_Panorama_in_Europe_NC.svg">this one</a> or <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Freedom_of_panorama#/media/File:Freedom_of_Panorama_world_map.png">this one</a> with your attendees to show just how messy it is when so many different countries treat copyright differently. You can even see an interactive version of how different rules change by country <a href="http://copyrightexceptions.eu/#Art.%205.1">here</a>.
postcrimes_step_2_5=As you show one of the maps, say something like this to your group:
postcrimes_step_2_6=Take a look at this map. Each color represents a different policy about taking pictures. You don’t need to be a copyright expert to see how complex and challenging it is to figure out copyright in the EU.
postcrimes_step_2_7=You also don’t need to be an expert to see that many countries limit creative expression and everyday activities - like taking a photo and sharing it online while on holiday - because of copyright.
postcrimes_step_2_8=There are also just as many policies about sharing content - like links and memes - online. Should remixing or sharing links be a crime?
