product_1_title=Dyson Pure Hot+Cool Link
product_1_blurb=For when your air isn’t quite good enough, there’s this air purifier/heater/cooler from Dyson. It’s not just air purification, it’s “Intelligent Air Purification” according to the maker. That means it comes with an app that lets you monitor your air quality and react accordingly. It’s 2017 and “scheduled purification” is now a thing.
product_1_worst_case=It could show when you are home and what is happening in your home based on the air quality readings (for example, if you are smoking).

product_2_title=Ring Doorbell 2
product_2_blurb=Door knockers are cool, but so old-fashioned. Door bells are neat, but so analog. Welcome to the future. Calling this a doorbell is a bit misleading. It’s a door video, two-way audio, motion sensor, infrared night vision gizmo that lets you see, hear, and speak to people at your door from your phone or computer. But is it creepy? You decide.
product_2_worst_case=It could be used to spy on your comings and goings.

product_3_title=Sengled Snap
product_3_blurb=Look up. It’s a light bulb. It’s a video camera. It’s… both? Yes, there is a Wi-Fi enabled, motion detecting, night vision, weatherproof light bulb with a built-in HD video camera. Controlled by an app, it sees all, live streams it to your phone, and stores it in the cloud. No word yet on how many people it takes to screw it in.
product_3_worst_case=It could be used to spy on you when you’re naked or doing other such things.

product_4_title=August Smart Door Lock
product_4_blurb=Sometime soon, that “Oh crap!” feeling of getting locked out of your house will be as foreign to kids as rotary phones are now thanks to the “smart lock.” Install it on a deadbolt and you can lock and unlock your door with your phone, give people keyless access to your home, and even track who is coming and going while you are away. Apparently it still works with old school keys, for that “Oh crap!” moment when you lose your phone.
product_4_worst_case=It could unlock the door unexpectedly or get hacked and open your door to a stranger.

product_5_title=Eero
product_5_blurb=Mesh used to mean those hair nets people wore in your elementary school cafeteria. These days, mesh is all the rage when it comes to Wi-Fi technology to cover your entire home, from your backyard to your basement bathroom. This Wi-Fi router system says it uses TrueMesh™ technology, which sure sounds fancy. They do nail their slogan: “Happy Wi-Fi, happy life.”
product_5_worst_case=As with any Wi-Fi router, it could know everything you are doing on the internet.

product_6_title=Chamberlain MyQ Smart Garage Hub
product_6_blurb=Garage doors refuse to be left out of the Internet of Things revolution. Good for them!

So the next time you go on vacation and wonder, “Huh?, did I close the garage door?”, this gadget has you, and your garage, covered.
product_6_worst_case=It could know when you are home and it could open your garage door for random strangers if hacked.

product_7_title=iDevices Switch
product_7_blurb=Remember the clapper? That wonderful device from last century that turned your lights on and off with clap of your hands. It’s almost 2018 and the clapper is all grown up into a “connected smart plug.” Plug the outlet into your wall and you can control it with your voice, set up custom on/off schedules on a phone app from anywhere, even monitor your energy use. All that’s missing is the catchy jingle — Clap on, clap off…
product_7_worst_case=It could turn things on and off when you don’t want it to. And learn things about your household based on whatever is plugged into the device.

product_8_title=Aumi Smart Nightlight
product_8_blurb=This little nightlight of mine, I’m gonna let it shine… just as soon as I pull out my phone and use the app to turn it on. That’s the tune you’ll be singing with this Bluetooth enabled, motion activated nightlight. It even lets you choose from 16 million different color options to find just the right color to keep those scary nighttime monsters at bay.
product_8_worst_case=It could know when you put your kids to bed and how often they get up at night.

product_9_title=Parrot Pot
product_9_blurb=Meet the smart flowerpot. Yup, a smart flowerpot. Because even people with green thumbs need to go on vacation. It comes with a self-watering system and built-in sensors the company says monitor things like fertilizer, moisture, light, and temperature levels. The robots really are going to replace us all.
product_9_worst_case=It could know when you’ll be out of town.

product_10_title=Tile Mate
product_10_blurb=This little nub attaches like a key ring and keeps track of anything: your pets, wallet, keys, bags, other people’s bags. The app lets you track your things and rings where they are if you lose something. It’s small enough to fit in the case grandma keeps her reading glasses in, so she will never lose them again! Only where did she put her phone?
product_10_worst_case=It could track you everywhere you go.

product_11_title=Amazon Echo/Show
product_11_blurb=Show, don’t tell, the saying goes. Amazon took that to heart. Take the helpful home secretary that is Alexa and add video — now this home hub can show you things while it talks to you. Show shows the lyrics to the song you’re listening to, weather forecasts, your security cams and baby monitor. It can also hear you at any time, from any direction. OK, that’s where things start to get weird.
product_11_worst_case=It could be used to spy on you when you’re naked or doing other such things.

product_12_title=B&O PLAY Beoplay M5
product_12_blurb=Are you an audiophile? Do you want a high-end wireless speaker? Do you have $600 to drop on one speaker? If so, this is for you. Seems like a lot of cash for a speaker to stream Spotify on. But it does come with a “pearl-blasted” aluminum disc the maker says is “beautiful to behold” and “mesmerizing to touch.” For $600 it better grant someone a wish when they rub its pearl-blasted aluminum top.
product_12_worst_case=It could let people can guess who is at home based on what music is playing.

product_13_title=Nanoleaf Aurora
product_13_blurb=You’re a rock star! Why not light up your bedroom like a one? Now you can with this “smart lighting product.” Hang these Wi-Fi connected triangular light panels together in whatever designs you dream up. Then download the app and customize the light’s movement, color, and schedule. If you want to add a little more bowchickawowow to your room, get the module that let’s the lights beat in rhythm to your music. You are a rock star after all.
product_13_worst_case=It could know when you are sleeping and when you are awake… and when you are having a big party with all your friends.

product_14_title=Samsung SmartThings Home Monitoring Kit
product_14_blurb=This is billed as “everything you need to monitor your home from anywhere using your smartphone”. Here’s a story about that:  Someone once tried putting cameras in their home. Mostly they wound up goofing off, looking at the camera on their phone while standing in front of their security camera. But then one night, they woke up and opened the app and for a split-second wondered how freaked out they would be if they saw a man in a clown suit on the infrared night camera. He slowly opens the door to their house, walks in front of the camera and disappears in a fisheye haste toward the hallway. They’re in their bed and hear footsteps on the stairs, which they then hear two seconds later louder in their phone and their heart starts pounding and… it turns out, security cameras in the home aren’t for everyone.
product_14_worst_case=It could know your daily routine and that data could be used against you.

product_15_title=Target Threshold Smart Table Lamp
product_15_blurb=Could light switches soon go the way of the dinosaur? Seems that’s the trend with smart lights these days. Turn this collection of lights from Target on or off with a touch or tap in the Target Connected app. The app also lets you set a timer and adjust the warmth of the light — but only on iOS Apple devices. Sorry Android users, you’re stuck with the light switch.
product_15_worst_case=It could know when you are sleeping and when you are awake.

product_16_title=Sonos Play:1
product_16_blurb=Described as both mini and mighty, this speaker is Wi-Fi, not Bluetooth which means a phone call won’t stop the jams, if that’s a thing you worry about. It’s also billed as “humidity resistant” which the makers claim makes it good for the bathroom. Controlled with an app, it lets you play different songs in different rooms (if you have more than one speaker), so you can listen to something loud in the bathroom and something quiet in the bedroom.
product_16_worst_case=It could share data with others that you are depressed because of your sad playlist.

product_17_title=Philips Hue White & Color Ambiance Starter Kit
product_17_blurb=Lights that dance with your music, jump with your movies, or pound with your videos games — maybe this isn’t tech that will save the world. But lights that can gradually get brighter in the morning to help you wake up or glow softly for reading do sound like a better way to light up your life. Toss in the ability to set timers and control with your voice when paired with a home hub and things could be looking a little brighter.
product_17_worst_case=It could infer activity in your home.

product_18_title=Nest Thermostat
product_18_blurb=Learning is fun! Owning a thermostat that learns all about how warm and cool you like your house is maybe fun too? According to the makers, use this thermostat for a week and it’ll adapt to you. The app lets you control the temperature in your home from anywhere and sends alerts when things don’t look quite right. Best of all, that learning can help save energy and money. The big question is, can it learn whose side to pick when you like it hot and your partner likes it cold?
product_18_worst_case=It could determine your comings and goings and turn your thermostat off when it’s really cold and you’re not home.

product_19_title=Nest Protect
product_19_blurb=Is there anything worse than the random chirp of a smoke alarm? You can’t tell which alarm is chirping. You don’t know if it’s smoke or a low battery. It’s so frustrating. Maybe there’s a better option? This smoke and carbon monoxide detector tells you what it’s sensing and in which room. It tests itself so you don’t have to remember to and lights up in the middle of the night when you walk under it. Best of all, you can silence it right from your phone. No need to haul that ladder around the house at 2am.
product_19_worst_case=It could ignore a fire.

product_20_title=Nest Cam Outdoor Security Camera
product_20_blurb=Russian dashcams changed the viral video world. Perhaps your front door cam can too. This weatherproof, always-on, HD video cam records everything, for better or worse. It has a built-in camera and mic too, so you can talk back to the delivery guy or the neighborhood kid selling candy bars for school. View, share, and get alerts all from an app on your phone — gives a whole new meaning to the idea of “neighborhood watch.”
product_20_worst_case=It could be used to spy on you when you’re naked or doing other such things.

product_21_title=Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera
product_21-blurb=Cameras are everywhere these days. If you want to jump on the bandwagon and put security cameras up in your house, here’s one that alerts you when it detects motion or loud noises, says it can tell a person from a thing, and lets you talk back to them. Which is either handy when it comes to chasing away the bad guys, or tons of fun when it comes to scaring the pants off your buddy who’s looking after your cat.
product_21_worst_case=It could be used to spy on you when you’re naked or doing other such things.

product_22_title=Meural Canvas
product_22_blurb=Ever buy a painting, hang it up, then get bored with it after a while? Yeah, me neither. For some people though, that happens. And for those people, there’s this digital art canvas. It’s a fancy Wi-Fi connected art frame with a built-in HD screen that changes art with a swipe of your hand. Upload your own artwork or download some from thousands of artists, who make 60% of what Meural earns on their art. Neat.
product_22_worst_case=It could use the ambient light sensors the comings & goings in your household.

product_23_title=Roomba 980
product_23_blurb=Let’s face it, vacuuming sucks. Then along came the robot vacuum and you could sit back and watch while it did all the work, sometimes taking your cat along for the ride. Now this Wi-Fi connected robot vacuum lets you push a button and vacuum your house from the other side of the world. Or schedule your robot to vacuum when you’re at work. The only downside? Who will be around to capture the next viral cat-riding-a robot-vacuum video.
product_23_worst_case=The roomba creates maps of your home. Those could be used for future advertising purposes. Or someone could gain access to those maps for more nefarious purposes.

product_24_title=Hiku
product_24_blurb=In any home, few things are more important than the humble grocery list. Now there’s a “smart shopping button” for when pen and paper feel so out-dated. Speak your deepest grocery store desires to it and they automatically appear in a shared shopping list app on your phone. It also scans barcodes and connects to online grocery stores. The most useful feature might be the ability to organize your list to match the way you walk the aisles in your grocery store. Now that’s progress!
product_24_worst_case=It could use your shopping list to learn your eating habits and other private habits.

product_25_title=Google Home
product_25_blurb=“Help Is Here,” they say on their website, and you think, “I need help!” This home hub is the brain and right hand enabler of your connected life.

product_26_title=Flic
product_26_blurb=Ever wanted a handy button on your desk you could push and have, say, a butler bring you a Diet Coke? This product is a little like that. It’s a little silicone button — about the size of a peppermint patty — and it pairs up with all sorts of apps on your phone. Set it up and then push the button to call an Uber, order a pizza, play music, even let your family know you’ve fallen and you can’t get up.
product_26_worst_case=You can connect your Flic button to anything — your lights, your calendar, 911. Someone else could gain access to all of that.

product_30_child_rules=Yes. The messages that users under 13 select from a pre-determined list of messages to send to other users. For example, a child may select the message “Hello!” to send to another user. A user under 13 will not be able to type a message to send to other users.

product_32_title=Toymail Talkie

Even walkie-talkies have gotten a furry, Wi-Fi, app-filled upgrade. These cute little animals — dinosaurs, unicorns, bunnies, bats, and more — disguise a Wi-Fi enabled box parents can set up to allow their kids to talk to approved friends and family via an app. Kids can chat toy to toy too, just like the old walkie-talkie days… sorta.

product_33_worst_case=Your little robot could be programmed to get crushed somehow.

product_34_title=Osmo
product_34_blurb=Screen play time is so 2D. Especially for young kids who need to be developing those fine motor skills. This game system is designed to be hands on iPad play. There’s IRL things like blocks, triangles, pizza, matchbox cars, numbers, and drawing pads that link up to the iPad for “hands-on” screen time. Or, you know, you could play with those things the old-fashion way.
product_34_worst_case=Someone could turn on your iPad/iPhone camera and watch you without you knowing.

product_35_title=Smart Letters
product_35_blurb=Kids love screens. Parents hate the guilt of letting their kids have too much screen time. Here’s a compromise.

Or send the little guy out to patrol on his own. It also comes with something called “holographic simulation” which seems very important in helping the Resistance. Hopefully there is no Dark Side here.
product_38_worst_case=Your little robot could record things happening in your home.

product_39_title=AirJamz Air Guitar
product_39_blurb=Admit it. There’s nothing better than nailing that air guitar solo. In your mind, you’re as cool as Jimi Hendrix and just as talented. If you love air guitar (and let’s be honest, who doesn’t?) this product seems life changing. It’s a little pick that connects to your phone via Bluetooth and lets you jam to your favorite iTunes songs. They call it a “karaoke-like experience”. It seems even cooler than that. Too bad it only works on iOS devices.
product_39_worst_case=Nothing. Have a great time jamming!

product_40_title=Hello Barbie
product_40_blurb=Two years ago Hello Barbie became the poster child for the dangers of connected toys for kids. It listened to and recorded kids using a microphone, sent that data to live on the company’s servers, those recordings were shared with third parties, and the Wi-Fi and app Hello Barbie used could easily be hacked, potentially letting strangers listen to your children. Hello Barbie is still around with some updates to the privacy and data storage policies. It’s up to you to decide if that’s good enough to feel safe giving this toy to your kids.

Play online with your friends or alone on your couch. Use it as your Blu-ray player, your Netflix box, and your Spotify hub. It’s all way too much fun. Just make sure you read up on that thing called two-factor authentication.
product_42_worst_case=It could be used to make assumptions about you based on what games, TV shows, and other apps you use and when. It could let others know when you are home playing your PS4.

product_43_worst_case=It could be used to make assumptions about you based on what games, TV shows, and other apps you use and when.

product_44_title=Quell
product_44_blurb=Pain sucks. Opioid addiction sucks. Wearing something on your leg that zaps your sensory nerves, to make your brain close its pain sensory gates throughout your whole body…sounds like a pretty cool option to fight chronic pain. It’s sort of like turning on some soothing “white noise” for your brain’s pain center. You control the frequency and intensity of zaps with an app on your phone.
product_44_worst_case=It could know when you are doing pain therapy. It could also start zapping you in unexpected ways.

product_45_title=Hatch Baby Rest
product_45_blurb=Night lights used to be about keeping us safe from the scary monsters under the bed. Meet the “smart night light” that says it can help keep your toddler out of <em>your</em> bed.

product_46_title=Fitbit Surge

product_50_title=Kinsa Smart Ear Thermometer

product_53_blurb=Not all scales are evil (Looking at you bathroom scales. You lie!) This handy dandy sounding little kitchen scale connects to a handy dandy sounding recipe app over Wi-Fi to help you make great food.
