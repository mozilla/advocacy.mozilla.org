              Paola is a self-taught systems programmer who, since 1998, has worked and played with all things “open” in governments, NGOs, and the private sector. She previously worked with the government of Mexico City on several civic innovation projects to build real, effective tools that defend democracy. She has also worked at Xamarin Inc. Her passion for open government and data, civic tech, and civil rights has fomented a curiosity to explore how and where technology, openness, and code can strengthen human rights. During her fellowship, Paola collaborated with the ACLU of Massachusetts on various projects, and started building <a href="http://dev.justicesos.org/" target="_blank">Data for Justice</a> using open data from the City of Boston to show where police officers perform stop-and-frisks and fight the war on drugs.
